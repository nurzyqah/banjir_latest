# Malaysia Flood Dashboard - Project Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps and milestones for developing the Malaysia Flood Dashboard. The project aims to create an interactive, web-based application that displays real-time data about flood relief centers (Pusat Pemindahan Sementara - PPS) across Malaysia. The goal is to provide a user-friendly platform for authorities, relief organizations, and the public to monitor the status of evacuation centers during floods.

## Objectives
- **Develop an interactive web dashboard**: Display information on flood relief centers, including capacity, victims, and families.
- **Ensure responsive design**: The dashboard should be accessible and usable across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Implement error handling**: Gracefully handle scenarios where data fails to load.
- **Simulate dynamic data**: Use dummy data for initial development and simulate real-time updates.

## Milestones
### 1. Project Setup & Initial Planning (Week 1)
- **Goal**: Set up the project repository and finalize the basic structure of the project.
- **Tasks**:
  - Initialize Git repository and create project files (`index.html`, `banjir.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`).
  - Draft the project concept and gather necessary resources (dummy data, images, etc.).
  - Prepare basic wireframe/mockup for the dashboard interface.

### 2. Develop Basic Web Structure (Week 2)
- **Goal**: Implement the basic structure and layout of the dashboard.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create HTML structure for the page (headers, footers, table container, etc.).
  - Write CSS for responsive layout (media queries for different screen sizes).
  - Design and implement the table to display PPS data (with static, dummy data for now).
  - Set up loading/error messages for data fetching.

### 3. Implement Data Handling (Week 3)
- **Goal**: Implement JavaScript to handle data dynamically.
- **Tasks**:
  - Write JavaScript to simulate fetching dummy data and populating the table.
  - Use D3.js to bind data to the HTML table elements.
  - Implement sorting and filtering of the table by state, district, or capacity.
  - Implement error handling for scenarios where the data fails to load.

### 4. Testing and Debugging (Week 4)
- **Goal**: Test the dashboard on various devices and fix bugs.
- **Tasks**:
  - Test the functionality of the table on multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
  - Ensure that the error messages are displayed correctly when data fails to load.
  - Debug any issues related to sorting, filtering, and data binding.
  - Validate that the layout is responsive and the user interface is intuitive.

### 5. Documentation and Final Touches (Week 5)
- **Goal**: Finalize the project with proper documentation and polish the design.
- **Tasks**:
  - Write the README.md file with detailed information about the project.
  - Create the CONCEPT.md and PLAN.md files to document the project's concept and plan.
  - Add finishing touches to the design (colors, fonts, spacing).
  - Test on multiple browsers for compatibility.

### 6. Future Enhancements (Post-launch)
- **Goal**: Plan future updates and improvements for the dashboard.
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate live data sources (e.g., APIs for flood relief centers).
  - Implement geolocation features to display nearby flood relief centers.
  - Add interactive maps to visualize the location and capacity of PPS.
  - Introduce notifications or alerts when PPS capacities are full or nearing full.

## Timeline

| Task                          | Start Date  | End Date    | Duration |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Project Setup & Initial Planning | Week 1      | Week 1      | 1 week   |
| Develop Basic Web Structure    | Week 2      | Week 2      | 1 week   |
| Implement Data Handling        | Week 3      | Week 3      | 1 week   |

## Resource Allocation

- **Team Members**:
  - **Frontend Developer**: Responsible for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (D3.js) implementation.
  - **Designer**: Assists with the layout, colors, and user interface (UI) design.
  - **Project Manager**: Oversees the timeline, milestones, and documentation.

- **Tools and Technologies**:
  - **HTML**: For building the structure of the web page.
  - **CSS**: For styling and ensuring responsiveness.
  - **JavaScript (D3.js)**: For creating dynamic tables and data handling.
  - **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
  - **Browser Developer Tools**: For debugging and testing the project on various devices.

## Risk Management

- **Data Loading Failures**: Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to handle data loading failures.
- **Responsiveness Issues**: Conduct cross-browser and cross-device testing to ensure that the dashboard is accessible and functional on various platforms.
- **Complex Data Integration**: The project initially uses dummy data, but integration of live data may involve challenges in terms of data format, consistency, and API integration.

## Conclusion
This plan outlines the key steps and milestones for developing the Malaysia Flood Dashboard. The main objectives include creating a user-friendly, responsive, and dynamic dashboard that displays real-time flood relief center data. By following this structured plan, the project is set to be completed within five weeks, with ongoing improvements planned post-launch to enhance functionality and features.
